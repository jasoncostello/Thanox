Thanox Ultra
======

Thanox Ultra is an open-source display font. It was created a few years ago and it's the first typeface that I've designed. It's not elegant but I feel the design is still interesting. I'm excited to see where this goes. Improvements forthcoming. 

My original intention was to create a massive typeface inspired by blockbuster graffiti lettering (specifically, the artist Espo/Steve Powers) and supermassive black holes. It's the typeface you'd use to number a tank that would be employed to combat Giger's alien. It's The Future, according to 1987. Fun stuff: it has some alt characters and a "Qu" ligature.

You're more than welcome to use it if you'd like to.
